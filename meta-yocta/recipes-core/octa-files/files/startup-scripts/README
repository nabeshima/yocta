The startup sequence is,

Kernel reads /etc/inittab at first
/etc/inittab sets 
  /etc/init.d/rcS to call it after kernel boot.
  /etc/init.d/rcK to call it when shutdown

/etc/init.d/rcS calls mount and /etc/rcS.d/S* in the dictionary oder.

/etc/rcS.d/S* are all symlinks to /etc/init.d/*

- S00: sysinit
  calls mount, hostname
  starts syslogd

- S98: startup	
  starts dbus  
  calls remount
  calls /bin/bash


If the shuting down is happily processed,
/etc/init.d/rcK calls /etc/rcS.d/K* in the dictionary oder.

/etc/rcS.d/K* are all symlinks to /etc/init.d/*
